This program measures the effectiveness of multiple data cache organizations and prefetching
techniques.
A sample input file will contain approximately 1 million instructions of 

Organizations used:

- Direct-Mapped Cache
- Set-Associative Cache
- Fully-Associative Cache
- Set-Associative Cache with Write Miss (if missed, instruction writes directly to memory)
- Set-Associative Cache Next-Line Prefetching 
- PreFetch upon Miss

- Note that the code uses several function definitions with only slight modifications. 
Due to time constraints, this implementation is by no means the most space-efficient solution.
